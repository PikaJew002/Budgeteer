# Budgeteer

Budgeteer is a simple low-complexity budget app for keeping track of when bills are due and what paychecks are designated to pay them. This app doesn't do expense trackings and syncing with bank accounts. There are plenty of other apps that try and solve that problem.
With this "bill first" mindset, this is aimed at simply making sure you know which paychecks cover which bills.

The solution that Budgeteer gives is this: you define the monthly bills and when you get paid, assign bills to paychecks. That's it. Simple, low-complexity solution.

## Free Hosted SaaS Version

Currently, I'm hosting the app on a cheap VPS. This repo is just the code for the app. If you like it, you can use it! I've deployed the app at [here](https://www.budgeteer.aaroneisenberg.me) and public registration is open, but to login in after registration you'll need to be verified. After registration, I get a notification and will decide whether or not I'll verify your account. As I have no documentation on how to use the app (yet), if you have ideas or just general feedback [shoot me an email](mailto:budgeteer@aaroneisenberg.me). If you'd like to rip me a new one anonymously... it's the internet: go make a fake gmail or something. Or submit an issue here on GitHub. Anyways, hope those who use it find it helpful and can give me any kind of feedback. Cheers!
