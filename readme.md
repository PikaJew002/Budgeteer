# Budgeteer

Budgeteer is a simple low-complexity budget app for those people who are concerned with really only one aspect of a budget: making sure bills get paid and you're not left broke.
With this "bill first" mindset, this is aimed at the niche group of people who have monthly bills, but are paid every two weeks.
This is actually quite a lot of people. So, why Budgeteer? Let me break down the problem this app solves:

## The Problem

- Monthly bills = 12 bill/year
- Paid every two weeks = 52 paychecks/year

If you're like me and live off of two paychecks to cover monthly expenses, this represents a conundrum.
- 52/2 = 26
- 26/2 = 13
- 13, not 12.

So, I get paid for 13 "months", but have 12 months of bills. How do I decide what bills get paid with which paychecks? Enter Budgeteer.

## The Solution

The solution that Budgeteer gives is this: you define the monthly bills and when you get paid, assign bills to paychecks. That's it. Simple, low-complexity solution.
Currently, I'll be hosting the app on my own private server for my own private use. But here's the source code. If you like it, you can use it!

In the near future, it will live at budgeteer.ironmthome.com, for production testing purposes. If and when that happens shoot me an email if you'd like to use it. The only thing I ask is that you'd provide me with come feedback, in exchange for use of my server space. We both win! You get a soon to be great budget app and I get user feedback!

## Under Construction!

Full disclosure, the app is near production testing ready (more on that to come) and therefore not fully functioning. In the next month or so (eyes on March 2020), it will go live. As opening registation to the general public on a shared hosting platform is, uh, a stupid idea, I will allow anyone to register, then make an effort to reach out to each registrant and (based on response), grant access (verify account) for unlimited use. As of now, I have no documentation on using the app so that might be up to early testers to help me out with. Cheers!
