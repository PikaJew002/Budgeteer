# Budgeteer

Budgeteer is a simple low-complexity budget app for those people who are concerned with really only one aspect of a budget: making sure bills get paid and you're not left broke.
With this "bill first" mindset, this is aimed at the niche group of people who have monthly bills, but are paid every two weeks.
This is actually quite a lot of people. So, why Budgeteer? Let me break down the problem this app solves:

## The Problem

- Monthly bills = 12 bill/year
- Paid every two weeks = 52 paychecks/year

If you're like me and live off of two paychecks to cover monthly expenses, this represents a conundrum.
- 52/2 = 26
- 26/2 = 13
- 13, not 12.

So, I get paid for 13 "months", but have 12 months of bills. How do I decide what bills get paid with which paychecks? Enter Budgeteer.

## The Solution

The solution that Budgeteer gives is this: you define the monthly bills and when you get paid, assign bills to paychecks. That's it. Simple, low-complexity solution.
Currently, I'll be hosting the app on my own private server for my own private use. But here's the source code. If you like it, you can use it!

## Under Construction!

Full disclosure, I just had this idea last night and threw together this repo to stick this out in the world. As I implement this idea, stuff will start to appear. Right now, this is just a stub of a Laravel/VueJS project that's just sitting here.
